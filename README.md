SE Studio Plugins
Will soon hold a main plugin which has the feature to install all other plugins.

The first plugin will be the Update API plugin which will update the files after you made an edit in your local copy of SE.

The more plugins will consist of development tools, such as API explorers for the coders and Building Tools for Builders. (Yup! You will get a "place tree" function for example in that plugin!)

The plugin manager will allow you to switch on and off plugins.

All plugins will use SE for an easy integration.
